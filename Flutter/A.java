Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (7.3.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least 7.3.1 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (D:\Green-Egypt\Flutter\Gogreen\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (D:\Green-Egypt\Flutter\Gogreen\android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".
